The Greatest Rivalry In Comic Book History!!!
# MIDTERM: 
# TEAM BASED GITHUB PROJECT
*A few paragraphs of text for each point of view and at least one image for each is required. One team member must create a repository
on Github with a Readme. Add your partner as a collaborator. Put the appropriate information in the readme file (this will be basic,
because it’s a simple 1-off).
Each team member will create a branch and add their argument / position and image(s) to the app. Merge everything to the master
branch when you’re finished.*
