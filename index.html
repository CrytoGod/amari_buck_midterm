   <h2>Brief History Between Batman And The Joker:</h2>
    <h3>The Batman-Joker rivalry</h3> 
                <p class="brieft-history">Born in the 1940s, has evolved over the decades 
    into one of the most iconic conflicts in comic book history. Initially marked by the Joker's 
   sadistic violence and Batman's unwavering pursuit of justice, their dynamic shifted through 
   different eras, from the campy 1960s to the psychologically complex '80s. "The Killing Joke" 
   graphic novel solidified the Joker's backstory and obsession with Batman. In the modern 
   era, their rivalry has grown even more intense, exploring themes of chaos, sanity, and the 
   nature of heroism. Adaptations in various media have further cemented their legendary 
    conflict, making it an enduring cornerstone of Batman's character and Gotham City's mythology.
