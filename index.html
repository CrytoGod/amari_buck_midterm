   <h2>Brief History Between Batman And The Joker:</h2>
    <h3>The Batman-Joker rivalry</h3> 
                <p class="brieft-history">Born in the 1940s, has evolved over the decades 
    into one of the most iconic conflicts in comic book history. Initially marked by the Joker's 
   sadistic violence and Batman's unwavering pursuit of justice, their dynamic shifted through 
   different eras, from the campy 1960s to the psychologically complex '80s. "The Killing Joke" 
   graphic novel solidified the Joker's backstory and obsession with Batman. In the modern 
   era, their rivalry has grown even more intense, exploring themes of chaos, sanity, and the 
   nature of heroism. Adaptations in various media have further cemented their legendary 
    conflict, making it an enduring cornerstone of Batman's character and Gotham City's mythology.

      <h4> BATMAN IS BETTER THE JOKER </h4>
    </div>
  <!--This is debate paragraphs for batman better than joker-->
      <p class="rival-text">
        Batman is often considered superior to the Joker due to his unwavering commitment to justice and 
        his unyielding moral code. Unlike the Joker, who revels in chaos and anarchy, Batman operates within
        the confines of the law, using his intellect, combat skills, and technological prowess to protect Gotham City.
        Batman's tragic origin story and personal sacrifices further underscore his dedication to preventing others from
        experiencing similar pain. He channels his grief and anger into a mission for the greater good, striving to 
        create a safer, more just society. Additionally, Batman's ability to outsmart and outmaneuver his adversaries, 
        including the Joker, demonstrates his strategic prowess and resilience. While the Joker represents chaos and 
        nihilism, Batman stands as a symbol of hope, demonstrating that even in the darkest of times, one can choose 
        to rise above and make a positive impact on the world.</p>

        <h4> JOKER IS BETTER THAN THE BATMAN </h4>
        </div>
  <!--This is debate paragraphs for joker better than batman-->
      <p class="rival-text">The Joker, as a character, holds a unique allure that surpasses Batman 
        in many ways. He embodies an enigmatic complexity and psychological depth that delves into the
         realms of mental health and human nature. The Joker's unpredictability and adaptable nature
          make him a constantly engaging character, challenging both his foes and the audience.
           Unlike Batman, who follows a more predictable path of justice, the Joker stands as a symbol 
           of anarchy and freedom, pushing the boundaries and inviting contemplation on societal norms.
            Ultimately, the Joker's ability to captivate and question the very essence of order and chaos 
            places him on a pedestal that Batman, despite his heroism, cannot quite reach.</p>
